  - 1) Fork or any metal object              2) Hollowed out Tin Can                   
    3) Rubber Band                                   4) Piece of Mirror                                  
    5) Light source shining through a slit                                            
    6) Wall                                                7) Balloon
  - 1) Stretch a balloon over one end of the hollowed out can.                       
    2) Stick a small piece of mirror on this end.                                                    
    3) Tie the balloon to the can using a rubber band and make sure this end of the
    can is facing a wall.                          4) Create an apparatus where light
    passes through a slit using any light source.                                              
    5) Make sure the light hits the mirror.                                  6) Vibrate
    the fork on the other end of the can.
  - Notice that when you vibrate the fork by moving it rapidly, the light spot that
    is being reflected on the wall starts to move.
  - This phenomenon occurs because when a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes
    and compresses the air in front of it creating a region of high pressure. This
    region is called a compression.  This compression starts to move away from the
    vibrating object. When the vibrating object moves backwards,it creates a region
    of low pressure called rarefaction. As the object moves back and forth rapidly,
    a series of compressions and rarefactions is created in the air. These make the
    sound wave that propagates through the medium. This disturbance is what causes
    the balloon and thus the reflected light spot to move.
